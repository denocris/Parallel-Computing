# MIDTERM EVALUATION
## Background

You can find the explanation of the algorithm [here](http://staff.psc.edu/stbrown/ICTPWorkshop/ICTP_Jabobi_Project/jacobiBackground.html).

## Makefile
`make` to compile
`make run` to compile and run
`make plot` to see the solution using *gnuplot*
`make clean` to clean up



## Exercises
1. Parallelize and optimize `jacobi.c`
2. Perform weak and strong scalability tests (2 4 8 16 32 processors)
3. Write a report explaning what you have done and what you have understood. Push it on the master branch of your fork!
